  <title>What Happens When You Increase the Mass of the Sun</title>
  <h2>Adding a Solar Mass into the Solar System</h2>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p>Click anywhere within the grey area to add a solar mass. You can additionally toggle the other inner planets of the Solar System. There is a counter on the upper left corner of the simulation. On the upper right corner there are instructions for special places in time and space where if you click at the right place at the right time strange stuff will happen. Often after you chose one of those special pages you will have to refresh the page to choose a different one. </p>
  <h3>Backstory</h3>
  <p>Okay so basically there is an alien species attempting to exterminate us. They visited us a few days ago and did not like us very much, we're gonna call them the evil-doers. These evil-doers can create what we call a Mass Bomb. It is a special device that does the reverse of a nuclear bomb, it converts energy into mass. Through some quantum information device, with enough energy they can teleport an entire solar mass from another point in the universe right to where the bomb is. This can create catostrophic effects for us humans. For instance if the first case scenario is played out (labeled 1 in the sim) the mass bomb adds mass to the sun, this causes to Moon's orbit to destabalize and colide with the Earth (not good). Or if the bomb goes off at the second 1 scenario then the Moon can maintain its prbit, this is a best case scenario for us. The other two scenario's have the Earth and Moon system decoupled (2) or the Earth flung into space (3). Clearly these evil-doers should be taken seriously. </p>
